## Development Process
As a designer and developer I enjoyed working on the assignment very much. I have created a modular React application based on components to approach the assignment. I have also created a mock data API to simulate data retrieving and an interactive PieChart. I have been sure that the website is fully responsive using Flexbox and CSS Modules. 

I hope this assigment fulfill the requirements for the job position.

### Swipe sidebar
A missing feature from the DeGiro mobile app is a native/like sidebar draggable effect. 
Please check my project from your phone to demo the effect https://goo.gl/QDEFMA

### My financial application: Valorlist
I'd like to share with you my financial application that i have made during my spear time from scratch. From the Analisys server to the design and development of the application. Made with Angular 1.5 (Components) and Angular material, and currently being moved the client to React.
